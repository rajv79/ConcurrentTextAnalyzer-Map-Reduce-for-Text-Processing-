Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,  I fine stood
And looked down one as sorry as I could.
Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,  I fine stood
And looked down one as sorry as I could.
Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,  I fine stood
And looked down one as sorry as I could.
And looked down one as sorry as I could.
Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,  I fine stood
And looked down one as sorry as I could.And looked down one as sorry as I could.
Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,  I fine stood
And looked down one as sorry as I could.And looked down one as sorry as I could.
Two sorry diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
